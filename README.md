# Welcome to my Dart Practice Repository! ðŸš€

Here, I explore various Dart concepts, including variable declarations, control flow structures, loops, and more. This repository serves as a sandbox for honing my Dart skills and understanding fundamental programming concepts.

## What You'll Find:

- **Variable Declarations:** Explore different types of variables, including integers, strings, booleans, and dynamic types.
- **Control Flow Structures:** Dive into conditional statements like if-else statements and switch-case statements to control program flow based on conditions.
- **Loops:** Experiment with different types of loops such as for loops, while loops, and do-while loops for iterative tasks.
- **Function Declarations:** Practice defining and calling functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code.
- **Data Structures:** Experiment with Dart's built-in data structures like lists, maps, and sets to manage collections of data effectively.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even contribute to this repository. Let's learn Dart together! ðŸŽ‰
